        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I remember my mother making these potato tacos when I was growing up. We loved them! And they're great with mashed potatoes.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (3.25 ounce) package instant mashed potatoes (such as Idahoan™ Signature Russets Mashed Potatoes)</li>
            <li>½ cup diced onions</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>8 corn tortillas</li>
            <li>½ cup vegetable oil for frying, plus more as needed</li>
            <h3>Garnishes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Shredded lettuce</li>
                <li>Chopped tomatoes</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons Shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend</li>
                <li>Salsa</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare mashed potatoes according to package directions.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sautee diced onions in oil until tender and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add cooked mashed potatoes and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place tortillas on a plate. Heat in microwave until pliable, 15 to 20 seconds.</li>
            <li>Place 1/4 cup of potato mixture in each tortilla, fold in half and secure each end with toothpicks.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet until shimmering. Fry each taco until crispy and golden brown, about 1 minute on each side.</li>
            <li>Remove toothpicks and top with garnishes.</li>
        </ol>
